# PhotographyApp - Feature/Camera

  ####  This feature will allow users to take photos and share them with other users. I would like to find out how I could get users to post their content and present this to new users. This is so that I could setup some type of like/dislike system so that whoever gets voted more, will be presented on a leaderboard. Instead of only having one vote, which will be impossible for various users, I am thinking of a like system where whoever gets most likes is put towards the top of the leaderboard.
