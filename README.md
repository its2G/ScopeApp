# PhotographyOnTheMove

## 12/06/2024 - started 16:05pm

#### For this ongoing project, I am using React Native to run my applications on. I use this alongside my phone which has the Expo App. The use of the QR code allows me to visualise the project and get an idea of how my project is handled. 

#### I am currently using Supabase for BackEnd and its been good at handling storage (e.g. photos) alongside a table to input user data (usernames and passwords). In future preference, I plan on creating a web server from one of my old computers that will allow me to direct the photos taken to a new directory. I will have to consider how response my server is as its an old computer and hopefully, it will be able to handle my requests.
